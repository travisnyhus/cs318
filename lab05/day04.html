    <h3>Morning</h3>
    <p>
    I'm going to the outback. I've packed four shirts and a flashlight, who needs water?

    <h3>Afternoon</h3>

    The sun is beating down on me. I found myself involved in an altercation with a kangaroo. Those suckers can kick. I'll have a story to tell my mother Sydney when I get back.

    <h3>Night</h3>

    I think I may have gotten stung by a dangerous insect. Or it could have been the snake that I confronted before dinner. No help is near. I don't know if I'll make it. Tell my mother I love her.

    <p>
    Continental breakfast: that's where it's at. I had a delicious helping of eggs and a side of colorful fruits. The toast here in Australia is divine, but there was no bacon. This has spoiled my mood.

    <h3>Afternoon</h3>
    <p>
    I've decided to take a train to Melbourne. The guy sitting next to me is called Fillip, he's from Tanzania. We had an in-depth conversation about the Yankees. I prefer to watch cricket.

    <h3>Night</h3>

    <p>Melbourne is not what I expected. There are more trees than people. I like trees, but not people.</p>

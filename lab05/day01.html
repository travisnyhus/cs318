    <p>
    I woke up at 7:25am and immediately was squashed by a koala bear. It wasn't uncomfortable given the softness of koala fur, but I would have appreciated a warning at least.

    <h3>Afternoon</h3>
    <p>
    The tent I slept in last night was blown away by the strong Australian wind. I didn't realize how much I liked that tent until it was gone.</p>
    
    <h3>Night</h3>

    <p>I've decided to camp on a rock by the beach. I hope to venture into the city tomorrow.</p>

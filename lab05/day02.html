    <h3>Morning</h3>

    The rock I slept on was only slightly firmer than the mattress I have at home. I caught some crabs for breakfast, which were unsatsifactory.

    As I headed on into the city of Sydney, I am reminded of my mother, who is also named Syndey. I hope she is doing well.

    I passed by the Sydney Opera House and found a clownfish on the ground. It made me terribly sad. The hotel I am staying in is very clean, much cleaner than my apartment.</p>

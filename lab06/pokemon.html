        <span class="paragraph"><p>Jigglypuff is a playable character, but it must be unlocked by clearing the 1-Player mode with any character.

        <span class="paragraph"><p>Ukelele Pichu is a ukulele-playing Pichu that serves as the partner Pokémon to Ben or Summer in Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs. Its physical appearance is no different from an ordinary Pichu, other than the fact that it carries a ukulele on its back. The ukulele that it carries was made by Booker out of wood from the leftover parts of a boat, as mentioned early in the game, but after one of the Pokémon Pinchers breaks it, Booker makes a new, stronger one for it out of a special type of wood.</p></span>
